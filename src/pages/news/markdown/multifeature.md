In our September we announced multi-feature matching, which makes it possible to match multiple features of an individual simultaneously. Initially this functionality will be best leveraged on Flukebook, where dorsal, fluke detection, and body detection and individual ID are available for many different species.

We are excited to announce that this technique is [now published](https://www.cascadiaresearch.org/publications/Franklin_etal_2020JCetResManagement) in the Journal of Cetacean Research and Management.
