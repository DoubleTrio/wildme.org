SeadragonSearch is a collaborative Wildbook that seeks to expand our understanding of wild seadragon populations through meaningful community involvement. SeadragonSearch will use data from underwater imagery to track these unique fish across their distribution for a decade, providing a window into their lives as well as the health of their habitats.
