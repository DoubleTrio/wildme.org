Wild Me is releasing two data sets to spur new research into machine learning and wildlife Photo ID.

## Whale Shark Data Set

Our released whale shark (Rhincodon typus) data set represents a collaborative effort based on the data collection and population modeling efforts conducted at Ningaloo Marine Park in Western Australia from 1995-2008 (Holmberg et al. 2008, 2009). Photos (7888) and metadata from 2441 whale shark encounters were collected from 464 individual contributors, especially from the original research of Brad Norman and from members of the local whale shark tourism industry who sight these animals annually from April-June. Images were annotated with bounding boxes around each visible whale shark and viewpoints labeled (e.g., left, right, etc.). A total of 543 individual whale sharks were identified by their unique spot patterning using first computer-assisted spot pattern recognition (Arzoumanian et al. 2005) and then manual review and confirmation.  A total of 7,693 named sightings were exported.

## Plains Zebra (GZGC) Data Set

Our dataset for plains zebra (Equus quagga) is taken from a two-day census of the Nairobi National Park, located just south of the capital’s airport in Nairobi, Kenya.  The “Great Zebra and Giraffe Count” (GZGC) photographic census was organized on February 28th and March 1st 2015 and had the participation of 27 different teams of citizen scientists, 55 total photographers, and collected 9,406 images of plains zebra and Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi) (Parham et al. 2017).  Only images containing either zebras or giraffes were included in the exported dataset, a total of 4,948 images, where the original biographical information of the original contributors are removed.  All images are labeled with bounding boxes around the individual animals for which there is ID metadata, meaning some images contain missing boxes and are not intended to be used for object detection training or testing.  Viewpoints for all animal annotations were also added.  All ID assignments were completed using the HotSpotter algorithm (Crall et al. 2013) by visually matching the stripes and spots as seen on the body of the animal.  A total of 2,056 combined names are released for 6,286 individual zebra and 639 giraffe sightings.  This dataset presents as a challenging comparison compared to the whale shark dataset since it contains a significantly higher number of animals that are only seen once during the survey.
