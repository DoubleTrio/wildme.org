Developer contributions are very much appreciated =). This app is written with React, Redux and Material-UI in hopes that it should be easy to work with. Take a gander at the [contribution guide](https://github.com/WildbookOrg/wildbook-frontend/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md). If you a Java dev looking to help with our project, take a look at the [backend](https://github.com/WildbookOrg/Wildbook). And if you are a Python dev or data scientist take a look at [IBEIS](https://github.com/WildbookOrg/ibeis). 

We are also looking for help from designers and 3D modelers! Please send an email to ben@wildme.org if you are interested.

## Development 

To successfully run the project, you will need to recreate one file that is gitignored for security reasons, `/src/constants/apiKeys.js`. Follow the instructions in the template located at `/src/constants/apiKeysTemplate.js`. After that, just run

```js
npm install 
npm start 
```

The development environment is mostly used on OSX but should work on Windows as well. Use Powershell or edit the `npm start:win32` command to set `NODE_ENV` using the appropriate syntax for your preferred shell.
