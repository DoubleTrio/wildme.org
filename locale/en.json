    "DRAGONSEARCH_DESCRIPTION": "DragonSearch is a collaborative research project that seeks to expand understanding of wild seadragon populations through meaningful community involvement. Seadragons are icons for marine biodiversity, but there are still many knowledge gaps for their conservation. DragonSearch will use data from underwater imagery to track these unique fish across their distribution for a decade, providing a window into their lives as well as the health of their habitats.",
    "SPOT_A_SHARK_USA_DESCRIPTION": "Spot A Shark USA is a citizen-science program that engages anyone who spends time on the water in sand tiger shark research along the Atlantic coast. Divers, snorkelers, and others are asked to photograph encounters with sand tiger sharks and post their images to the Spot A Shark USA website. Scientists then use unique spot patterns visible along the sides of the photographed sharks to identify individual animals. Identifying individual sand tiger sharks helps track shark movement and behavior over time. It also determines which coastal habitats sand tiger sharks use during their lives. This information is used by Spot A Shark USA researchers, as well as international partners, to facilitate management decisions aimed towards conserving sand tiger sharks, which are critically endangered in several parts of the world. ",
    "SPOT_A_SHARK_DESCRIPTION": "Engaging divers as citizen scientists is providing valuable information about sand tiger sharks including insights into their habitat needs, social structure, migratory patterns and reproductive cycles.",

    "LYNX_DESCRIPTION": "The monitoring and identification of the Iberian lynx is the cornerstone on which the conservation of this unique feline in the world is based. This tool is an essential support in this task because it is a great time saver and allows seamless exchange of information between the different organizations involved in monitoring. On the other hand, WWF in collaboration with WildBook, we want to open the study of the Iberian lynx to the general public, uniting citizen science with new technologies, so that any nature lover can contribute to the recovery of this species.",
    "ZEBRA_DESCRIPTION": "Wildbook for Zebras applies computer vision algorithms and deep learning to identify and track individual zebras across hundreds of thousands of photos. We help researchers collaborate with each other and citizen scientists contribute to the effort. A.I. scales and speeds research and conservation.",
    "IOT_DESCRIPTION": "The 'gold standard' for sea turtle population monitoring programs are long-term capture-mark-recapture (CMR) studies on nesting beaches as well as foraging areas for populations. Comprehensive CMR studies facilitate robust abundance assessments and diagnoses of population trends, which, in turn, inform effective conservation management efforts.",
    "GIRAFFESPOTTER_DESCRIPTION": "With less than 100,000 giraffe remaining in all of Africa and a decline of almost 40% over the last three decades, giraffe have moved from 'Least Concern' to 'Vulnerable' on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Speciesâ„¢. It is time to act now to save this iconic species from extinction!",
    "WHALESHARK_DESCRIPTION": "The whaleshark.org photo-identification library is an award-winning visual database of whale shark encounters and of individually catalogued whale sharks.
